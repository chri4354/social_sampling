# social sampling

This project is a agent-based study of polarization in networks of social agents. Each agent is trying to estimate the probability of a binary variable (probability of Heads in a coin flip). Nodes can sometimes observe the variable directly from their environment and sometimes indirectly by confronting their views with their neighbors. As observed in the lab, in the absence of any objective feedback or reference, nodes do not fully trust others but try to estimate their reliability based on their own internal model of the random variable. This simple mechanism, although arguably rational, induces clusters of opinions that are resilient to change, due to the circularity of estimating the reliability of external sources using one'own current model of the world. The results have direct implications for phenomena of group polarization and echo-chambers observed in natural environments (Sunstein, 2001).
